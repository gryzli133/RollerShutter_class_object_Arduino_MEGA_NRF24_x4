At the moment due to Domoticz problem with Blinds Percentage widget please use two widgets:
  - dimmer for percentage control and feedback
  - Venetian Blinds EU - for Up, down and STOP button

UPDATE:
From version 9 due to Domoticz Blinds Widget problem, sketch support also ON/OFF function of Dimmer's button. ON - 100%, OFF - 0%.
